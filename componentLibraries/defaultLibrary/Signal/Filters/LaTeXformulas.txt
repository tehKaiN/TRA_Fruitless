lp1filter: \(\displaystyle\frac{1}{\frac{s}{w}+1}\)
firstorder: \(\displaystyle\frac{\frac{s}{w_{1}}+1}{\frac{s}{w_{2}}+1}\)

lp2filter: \(\displaystyle\frac{1}{\frac{s^{2}}{w^2}+\frac{2d}{w}s+1}\)
secondorder: \(\displaystyle\frac{\frac{s^{2}}{w_{1}^2}+\frac{2d_{1}}{w_{1}}s+1}{\frac{s^{2}}{w_{2}^2}+\frac{2d_{2}}{w_{2}}s+1}\)

integrator: \(\displaystyle\frac{1}{s}\)
